Here I present "Weather to Drink?"

"Weather to Drink?" is a web app that will make a drink suggestion based on the weather at the location you select. The application not only displays weather information, it helps you figure out how to get drunk based on the current climate.

Unfortunately, my skills outside of design, HTML and CSS are limited and I was unable to figure out how to make this work - so I focused on the user interface along with the look and feel.

The application was coded responsively, so that it provides optimal viewing from multiple devices (for when you are checking the weather away from home). It's also fairly lightweight, as it only loads 2 images at a time (along with multiple js and css calls). 

There are two pages for two "typical" winter and summer days - and they each can be accessed from the other at the very bottom of the page.
